# Finding Your Writing Flow State

A Technical Writer’s job usually consists of juggling multiple projects
simultaneously and any interruption in the drafting stages can cause huge setbacks.
It’s important that they can focus and concentrate, or if possible, work in the state of flow.

Flow or as some may call it, being “in the zone” is a mental state in which a
person is completely absorbed in an activity (playing an instrument, exercising, writing etc.)
while experiencing a feeling of energized focus.
The Goal of flow is not to maximize productivity but it is still a tool that
can help you be productive, feel empowered and self-motivated.

When writers enter a flow state, it feels like you’re in your own world where
words come quickly to you, concepts are easily understood and you aren’t able to
be pulled away from what you are focused on. You feel challenged but not to the
point that we are out of our element, bored or frustrated. You aren’t consciously
thinking about what we did yesterday or what we have to do but in a state of
relaxed high performance. Time flies by and before you know it, hours have been
filled and there’s quality work to show for it.

Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi introduced the flow state and defined it as
an:

>“optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and perform our best”.


In *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience*, Csikszentmihalyi defines the
characteristics of flow:

* The work is challenging but within your scope.
* Your goals are clear; you know what needs to happen.
* The act of working provides clear feedback.
* Your mind is absorbed in the work at hand.
* You are not distracted by anything apart from the work.
* You lack self-consciousness.
* You do not notice time passing.
* The process is fulfilling or enjoyable.
### Tips to reach flow consistently:

**Choose your largest, highest priority task :** A flow state is more likely to be achieved while focusing on one major task or goal that requires intense focus. Attempting to multitask would only create distractions.
Find a quiet space that works for you. Whether it is at home or your office,
find a quiet place where you feel comfortable that will inspire you to write
and encourage you to be productive.

**Organize no meeting days:** Set a day a week without meetings to guarantee uninterrupted time to focus.

**Do your research:** Instead of having to stop and ask questions, record your meetings with
SMEs so that you are able to use your resources without creating interruptions.

**Create a Routine:**  Identify your most creative and productive times.
Identify the times where your mind most naturally functions at full speed.
